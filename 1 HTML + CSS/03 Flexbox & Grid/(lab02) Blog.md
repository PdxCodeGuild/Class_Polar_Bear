# Lab 2: Blog

Let's make the template of a blog with a title, top-nav, side-nav, and multiple posts. Use [grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) (header, nav, section, and footer). You can use a [custom font](https://fonts.google.com/), [fancy colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/), and make generate fake content using an [Ipsum](https://meettheipsums.com/).
