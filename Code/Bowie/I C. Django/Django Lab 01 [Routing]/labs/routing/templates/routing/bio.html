    <p>S. dysenteriae is the species of bacteria that is known for causing dysentery, an infection of the intestines that is sometimes referred to simple as a “shigella infection” or simply being sick with shigella.</p>

    <p>Although there are other dysentery causes, including completely different types of organisms such as Entamoeba histolytica, S. dysenteriae is likely the causative agent that someone is referring to when mentioning dysentery without other context.></p>

    <p>Where have Shigella dysenteriae been known to live?</p>
        
    <p>Shigella is known to inhabit the epithelial lining of the large intestine, including the: the ascending, transverse, and descending colon.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>ascending colon</li>
            <li>transverse colon</li>
            <li>descending colon</li>
            </ul>

    <p>If Shigella could speak, it might say:</p>
    <i>“fear me; for I release shiga toxin.”<i>
