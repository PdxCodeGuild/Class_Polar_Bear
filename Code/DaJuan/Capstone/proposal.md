# Capstone: Student Portal
### DaJuan Martin
#### Class Polar Bear, Winter 2021

## Project Overview
What are the major features of your web application? 
+ Dashboard with view of grades, finances, and messages
+ Easy-use interface

What problem is it attempting to solve? 
+ The inconvenience caused by a student not having information readily available.

What libraries or frameworks will you use?

## Functionality
Walk through the application from the user's perspective: 
What will they see on each page? 
+ Login
+ dashboard
+ grades
+ messages
What can they input and click and see? 
How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?

## Data Model
What data will you need to store as part of your application? 
In this section list out all the models you'll have and the fields on each of them.

## Schedule
Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. 
It's difficult to be certain how long each feature will take to develop, therefore you should plan out multiple 'milestones' for your project. That way, if you reach milestone 2 but not 3, you still have something worthwhile to present and be proud of. 
It also gives you the opportunity to plan out what you'd like to work on after the class is finished. 
For each milestone, state specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. 
This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.
