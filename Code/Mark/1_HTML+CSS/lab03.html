      <h1>Advancing Machine Intelligence with Neuroscience</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="blog">
      <p>Numenta’s deep experience in theoretical neuroscience research has led to tremendous discoveries about how the brain works. We have developed a framework called the Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence that will be fundamental to advancing the state of artificial intelligence and machine learning. By applying this theory to existing deep learning systems, we are addressing today’s bottlenecks while enabling tomorrow’s applications.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Deep learning systems have demonstrated impressive achievements but face significant scalability problems that cannot be solved simply by adding more data and power. A new approach is required, and the brain offers the best path forward.</p>
      <br>
      <p>How is the brain so efficient? It stores and processes information in a highly sparse manner. At Numenta, we understand sparsity, a foundational element of the Thousand Brains Theory. We’ve created a technology demonstration that validates sparse networks on inference tasks can unlock groundbreaking performance gains of more than 100x in deep learning networks with no loss of accuracy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Numenta’s sparse networks rely on key aspects of brain sparsity, most notably: activation sparsity (number of active neurons) and weight sparsity (interconnectedness of neurons). The combination of the two yields multiplicative effects, enabling large efficiency improvements.</p>
