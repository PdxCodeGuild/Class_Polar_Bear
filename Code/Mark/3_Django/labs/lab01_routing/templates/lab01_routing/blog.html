      <h3>Sequence Memory</h3>
      <p>Vernon Mountcastle proposed that because every part of the neocortex has the same complex circuitry, then every part is doing the same thing. Therefore, if we can understand a cortical column, we will understand the neocortex.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Through our focus on cortical theory, we seek to understand the complex circuitry of a cortical column. We want to understand the function and operation of the laminar circuits in the brain, including what the neurons are doing, what the layers are doing, how they interact, and how a cortical column works.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Cortical Columns</h3>
      <p>Building on Mountcastle’s proposal that the neocortex is made up of nearly identical cortical columns, we are working on filling in the pieces of the cortical circuit – understanding each layer, what the neurons are doing, and how a cortical column works.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As part of this research, we have proposed a framework, consistent with anatomical and physiological evidence, that explains how cortical columns function. The framework is based on how cortical columns learn sensorimotor models of the world by combining sensory inputs with location signals.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Sparse Distributed Representations</h3>
      <p>Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) are a foundational aspect of all of our theories. Everywhere in the neocortex, information is represented by distributed and sparsely active sets of neurons. We have shown through mathematical analysis and simulation that SDRs enable semantic generalization and robustness.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Memory and recall of sequences is an essential component of inference and behavior. We believe that sequence memory is occurring in multiple layers of the neocortex. We’ve shown how a layer of pyramidal neurons with active dendrites, arranged in mini-columns, will learn transitions of patterns and form a robust sequence memory.</p>
