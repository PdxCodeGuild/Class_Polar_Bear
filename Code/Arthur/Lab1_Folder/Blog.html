         <p>The story follows a ninja named Ryu Hayabusa as he journeys to America to avenge his murdered father. There, he learns that a person named "the Jaquio" plans to take control of the world by unleashing an ancient demon through the power contained in two statues.</p>
         <p>The series was originally known as Ninja Ryukenden, Ninja Ryūkenden, "Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword") in Japan. The word "gaiden" in the North American Ninja Gaiden title means “side story” in Japanese. The Ninja Gaiden franchise is known for its high degree of difficulty</p>

        <p>You have many of the typical moves we see from ninja games. You swing a sword, throw shurikens, and cling to walls. But even these standard abilities feel great. The Messenger’s controls are precise, and every move has satisfying visuals and sounds.</p>
        <p>The Messenger uses pixel art similar to the 8-bit style of the Ninja Gaiden games that inspired it, but the detail and color use in The Messenger goes far beyond anything the Nintendo Entertainment System could have managed. Backgrounds are gorgeous, and each level have a distinct feel that goes beyond typical video game cliches of “ice world” and “fire world.” I love a level that took place deep inside a bamboo forest.</p>
        <p> If you’re a fan of classic action-platformers, The Messenger is another indie game that you need to own. It’s much more than a tribute to Ninja Gaiden. This Switch and PC game cuts its own path with some inventive abilities and fun gameplay twists.</p>
