# Shipment Tracker

## A website to track all shipments to a persons's address

This project will allow the user to see all shipments coming to their address from all shipping companies they choose

The problem this is solving is the annoyance of having to check multiple shipping companies (as well as the online retailers you have purchased from) in order to track your incoming shipments, by aggregating all of that information into a dashboard displayed on one single page.


### This project will include the following functionalities

- Registration input, including address and phone number
- Retailer and shipping company input, including usernames and passwords so as to access the shipping data
- Dashboard with incomimg shipments that can be ordered by ship date, est. delivery date, shipping company, and retailer
- links in dashboard to users account at those retailers/shipping companies
- tracking number link that will open detailed tracking info on dashbaord


### Data Model
